# Node JS AUTHENTICATION

The code is a Node.js server using the Express framework. It provides routes for signing up and signing in users. It uses MongoDB as the database and Mongoose to connect to the database.

The /signup route allows users to register by checking if the user already exists in the database. If the user doesn't exist, their password is hashed and the user is created in the database.

The /signin route allows users to sign in by checking if the user exists in the database and verifying their password using the bcrypt library. If the user exists and the password is correct, a success message is sent. If the user doesn't exist or the password is incorrect, an error message is sent.

The / route provides a list of all users in the database. If an error occurs, an error message is sent.

The code exports the router object to be used in other parts of the application.
